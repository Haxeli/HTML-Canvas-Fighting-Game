# Fighting Game

This project was created using HTML-Canvas and JavaScript.


## All credit goes to [ChrisCourses](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChrisCourses), who did a great tutorial for this project.

### List of improvements compared to the original tutorial:
- All images have been resized appropriately in a photo editor rather than in code. This causes the sprites to maintain their original sharp textures.
- Sprites take FPS as a parameter for easy animation manipulation.
- Code checks for image loading.
